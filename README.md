# AMP Packager

The AMP Packager creates "AMP Packages" (implemented as [Signed HTTP
Exchanges](https://wicg.github.io/webpackage/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses.html))
containing your AMP documents. These packages are consumed by the [Google AMP
Cache](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/fundamentals/how_cached), cached, and
when available, linked to from Google Search instead of normal AMP page. The
packages are signed with your certificate, which means that Chrome users will
see your website in the URL bar instead of `google.com` or `ampproject.org`.

These packages have a maximum lifetime of 7 days, which minimizes the risk of
another cache serving a stale copy of this signed content. In the future, the
[AMP update-cache API](https://developers.google.com/amp/cache/update-cache)
will support updating AMP Packages, though it doesn't yet.

The packager is an HTTP server that sits behind your frontend server; it
fetches and signs AMP documents as requested by the AMP Cache.

## How to use

### Add <link> tags to your pages

In order for Google Search to discover these web packages, you must link to them
from the page that googlebot crawls (whether that page is AMP or non-AMP). Do so
like:

```html
<link rel="amppackage" href="https://example.com/url/to/amp/package.html">
```

The URL must be HTTPS, and it should be absolute.

Your frontend server must know how to convert these package URLs back into their
corresponding AMP URLs, so make it a static transformation of suchâ€”for instance,
prepending `/wpk/` or appending `.wpk` to the path:

```html
<link rel="amphtml"    href="https://example.com/url/to/amp.html">
<link rel="amppackage" href="https://example.com/wpk/url/to/amp.html">
```

### Configure your frontend server

The frontend server needs to forward two types of requests to the packager:
packages and certificates.

#### Packages

For URLs that look like `https://example.com/wpk/url/to/amp.html`, the frontend
server must internally reverse-proxy these requests to something like:

```
http://packager.internal/priv-amppkg/doc?fetch=http://www.internal/url/to/amp.html&sign=https://example.com/url/to/amp.html
```

Let's break that down:

  `http://` The packager itself only knows how to serve HTTP. Connections to it
  should remain inside your network. If you want encryption-in-transit (for
  instance if the connection to the packager travels outside your network), you
  may place a TLS-terminating proxy in front of it.

  `packager.internal` This is the location of the packager as known to the
  frontend server. By default Go parses `/etc/resolv.conf` for name resolution,
  but see [its documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/net/) for other options.
  You may append `:8080` or the like for a different port.

  `/priv-amppkg/doc` This is a fixed string. The frontend server must rewrite
  the URL to start with this.

  `?fetch=http://www.internal/url/to/amp.html` The location of the AMP document
  to package, URL-escaped for use in a query. The same URL transformation that
  you applied to the `<link>` tag should be reversed by the web server, and then
  the domain replaced with the domain of the internal server. The packager will
  fetch this URL anonymously (e.g. without a `Cookie` header). This URL can be
  HTTP or HTTPS. If HTTP, then the request should remain inside your network.

  `&sign=https://example.com/url/to/amp.html` The location that should appear
  in the browser's URL bar, URL-escaped for use in a query. This must be HTTPS,
  and must be on a domain that the packager's certificate can sign for. If the
  user hits Refresh on their browser, it will fetch from this URL, so it must
  contain the same content as the fetch URL. Like the fetch URL, the frontend
  server will need to statically derive this URL from the amppackage URL.

#### Certificates

AMP Packages will contain a `certUrl` that indicates the certificate that can be
used to validate the package. The `certUrl` may be on any domain, and it may be
HTTP or HTTPS, but it will have a path of the form:

```
/amppkg/cert/blahblahblah
```

where `blahblahblah` is a base64 encoding of a hash of the public certificate.
You may optionally prefix such URLs' paths, via the config file. The frontend
server must internally reverse-proxy these requests to the packager (without the
custom prefix).

### Configure the packager

The packager needs to be set up to receive reverse-proxied requests from the
frontend as specified above. In addition, it:

  * Must not be accessible on the open internet (even by IP address). To do so
    would allow external parties to fetch arbitrary documents and sign them with
    different arbitrary URLs. (We provide some mitigation of this in the config
    file, via `URLSet`s.)
  * Must have a certificate/key pair for all the domains you wish to sign. If
    you want to sign for multiple domains with different certificates, then run
    different instances of the packager. We recommend using a different
    certificate/key pair from your normal web-serving traffic. See the example
    config file for details.
  * Must be able to make outgoing connections to
    `amphtmltransformer.googleapis.com` on port 443.
  * Must be able to make outgoing connections to your internal AMP content
    server.
  * Must have an API key obtained from
    [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with access to the
    AMP HTML Transformer API, per
    [these instructions](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158862).
  * Should have its stdout redirected to a log file somewhere, probably rotated.
  * Should not run as superuser.

Once you've chosen a setup that meets the above constraints, actual
configuration is fairly straightforward:

  1. `git clone http://github.com/ampproject/amp-packager && cd amp-packager && go build main/amppkg.go`
  2. Move the built `./amppkg` wherever you like.
  3. Create a packager config file; use `amppkg.example.toml` in this repo as a template.
  4. Launch with `/path/to/amppkg --config=/path/to/amppkg.toml >>/path/to/amppkg.log`.
  5. Set up log rotation for `amppkg.log`.

### Test your config

  1. Download a [nightly build of Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium).
  2. Launch Chromium with the flag `--enable-features=SignedHTTPExchange`.
  3. Navigate to chrome://flags#enable-experimental-web-platform-features and
     enable that feature.
  4. Navigate to your AMP package URL (i.e. the `href` of your
     `<link rel="amppackage">` for a given page).
  5. Watch the URL transmogrify!

Optionally, you may pretend to be an AMP Cache:

  1. Use `wget` to download the package and save it as a `foo.wpk` file in an
     empty directory.
  2. Run the provided `test.py` in that directory.
  3. Ensure the packager is still running; it's needed to serve the certificate.
  4. Visit `http://localhost:8000/foo.wpk` in the experimental Chromium.

## Limitations

Currently, the packager will refuse to sign any AMP documents larger than 4 MB.

The Go http.Client implementation doesn't support redirect chains that rely on
cookies being set and then read later in the chain; all requests are made
cookielessly.
